Sure it's a knock off the late Great Kobe Bryant's Mamba Mentality. Yet the  Essestially the Mamba Mindset is the willingnes to overcome. It's the ability to understand and master 
 **YOUSELF**. It's the ability to accept your flaws and instead of beating yourself down with pity and avoidance. You learn to build apon them. Adopting this *NO EXCUSE* attitude can very much change your mental and physical capabilities.
 
 ## How?
 
 Easy! by followings these simple yet effective steps...
 
 1. Acknowlegde and Accept your shortcomings
 - You've heard it before, acceptance is the first step. Which is true in this case as well. Its important to identify that your feelings a tad bit restless this morning and are having a hard time focusing. GREAT! You figured it out! now you can accept the fact that maybe it's time to take a break, do some push ups or even reup on your 5th cup of MOJO. 
However you spend it, is up to you but just something as little as understanding when to step away and refocus or even starting a different, less stressful, task can pivot the productivity of the day.
