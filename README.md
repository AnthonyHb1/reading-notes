### The Growth Mindset 
The Growth mindset is the ability to identify, mangage and conquer your superfluities. By remaining resilient and persist through our daily struggles and moments of uncertainity by resulting to positive reenforcements to insure our maximium effort. Examples would include:

- Taking each failure or incomplete project as a learning experience
- Annotate completed task throughout the day to recount on your accomplishments to keep you inspiried to do more
- Knowing when to take a break. Can decrease the chances of avioding the **_Gumption Traps_** that can stagnant productivity.
