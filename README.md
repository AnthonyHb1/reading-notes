- Taking each failure or incomplete project as a learning experience
- Annotate completed task throughout the day to recount on your accomplishments to keep you inspiried to do more
- Knowing when to take a break. Can decrease the chances of avioding the **_Gumption Traps_** that can stagnant productivity.
