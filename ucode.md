WHAT'S YOUR MIND LIKE THESE DAYS?

Well here we are, at the brink of a new era... the new you! If you're switching or just starting your career, it is essestial to note that your mindset will be the deciding factor between success or failure.  Thats why we adopted the Growth Mindset, it's the ability to accept your flaws instead of beating yourself down with pity and doubt. You learn to build apon them. Adopting this *NO EXCUSE* attitude can very much change your mental and physical capabilities. As oppose to the fix mindset that would see no light at the end of that tunnel when challenges arise. You got this your a beast for even trying to improve. Go you!!
  
 ## How?
 
 Easy! by followings these simple, yet effective steps...
 
 1. Acknowlegde and Accept your shortcomings
 - You've heard it before, acceptance is the first step. Which is true in this case as well. Its important to identify that your feelings a tad bit restless this morning and are having a hard time focusing. GREAT! You figured it out! now you can accept the fact that maybe it's time to take a break, do some push ups or even reup on your 5th cup of MOJO. 
However you spend it, is up to you but just something as little as understanding when to step away and refocus or even starting a different, less stressful, task can pivot the productivity of the day.

2.You are not a Elephant
- Understand coding in any form is hard to get at first glance. So there is no point for you to add unneeded stress to an already full plate. There is no need to believe that you must remember everything. Don't get me wrong it's possible but not probable so instead take vocal or written notes, strengthen your google searches, watch video or even better phone a friend.

3. Iron strengthens Iron
- A solid routine can make a solid developer. Incooperate useful tools into your daily routine that can improve your mindset. Such as *REST*, excerise, healthy diets and even a form a manstras. Note positive self talk and rest is huge! Staying up until 2-3 in the morning working on that assignment to get ahead. Sounds good to show your a boss at what you do yet, it is a double edge sword. Remember coding is a marathon not a sprint. Take from step one and utilize those breaks and recharge that money maker ( Your Brain). Now I'm not recommending you pick up a yoga mat and become a vegan. Yet they couldn't hurt. What I am proposing is, take time to hone in on your quality of living that can improve your productity. As said before hype yourself up, tell yourself "you got this" because errors and uncertainity can definitely ruin your mood or worst the day. So get like Flava Flav and get hype son!
